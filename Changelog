2014-10-02 Matt:
	* Updating EField and APotPlots. Latest investigations have been added.
	* Tagging Version 00.04
	* Added options --flat <float> and --gauss <float> such that beam profile can be set
	* Adding short script to plot beam profile from output: PlotBeamProfile
		This script needs output from PrimaryGeneratorAction. Search f_test.
	* Adding some methods to myHist.C

2014-10-01 Matt:
	* Including corrected makeRefractedScan.py (forgot previously). Finished now
	* Updating Antenna.{cc,hh} to store angle information
	* Updating SetupAntenna to handle angle information
	* Updating EventAction to write the angle information to txt file
	* Updating refractive scane and everything mentioned above to handle calculation of the
		refracted electric field. Previous method was incorrect approach.
	* Updating EField calculation for the comparison refracted with unrefracted
	* Adding refractedAngles script to plot refracted angles vs. height

2014-09-30 Matt:
	* Changed antenna position for default to 1km for comparison with ZHS.
	* Checked agreement between ZHS and G4 for 40 MeV after bug fixes.
	* Added all plots to output root file from APotPlots.py
	* updated EField script to check scaling results. Everything seems consistent
	* Updated VPCompareZHS to include latest ZHS comparison files.
	* Updated iceblock from R10m to R1000m following update in antenna position
	* TODO: Add antennta default distance as a parameter
	* Adding makeRefractionScan.py -- This is still work in progress.
		- Right now for angles near critical angle, z increases when it should continue
		decreasing. I think it has to do with the sign ambiguity. Try to impose some
		requirements.

2014-09-29 Matt:
	* Updating some minor changes after figuring out difference with ZHS.
	* Committing verified version with velocity correction in place.
	* Committing E-field drawing script.  Need to add more modularity for future

2014-09-09 Matt:
	* Committing debugged vector potential calculation. Right now two ways to calculate the velocity.
	* Adding python script to make Vector potential plots
	* Adding python script to make Cherenkov Ring plots
	* Adding python script to make filelists for Zscan and Cherenkov scan
	* Adding scripts to compare velocity calculation procedure
	* Adding scripts to format cherenkov scan results
	* Adding script to format the vector potential comparison for ZHS vs. Geant4
	* Adding class for Antenna and one for setting up the antenna


2014-08-5 Matt:
	* Adding vector potential calculation. First pass looks reasonable.
	* Update SetupAntenna to loop over angles for fixed position.
	* Fixed timing bin factor in calculation of vector potential

2014-08-04 Matt:
	* Minor updates to settings.
	* Going to add calculation of electric field for step information. Tag first

2014-05-29 Matt:
	* Updating some minor changes during running.
	* Going to build realistic setup for ELS site.

2014-03-27 Matt:
	* Add plotting macro for shower comparisons
	* Update ntuple maker to account for nParticles

2014-03-25 Matt:
	* Add option to specify the number of initial particles.

2014-03-19 Matt:
	* Added option to set tracking threshold
	* Added script to make simple tree.  We will see if it is useful
	* Committing fixed version of code to make simple tree

2014-03-13 Matt:
	* Adding python scripts used to make all the plots
	* Adding C scripts for formatting plot output
	* Adding submission scripts to give idea of how to run

2014-03-12 Matt:
	* TTree takes too long! Going back to text files.
	* Added modularity to save both track and step output in separate files.

2014-03-10 Matt:
	* After many changes, finally figured out my issue with particle counting. Commit changes before next update.
	* Next Update will be to create a TTree to be output of Geant information.

2014-02-14 Matt:
	* Committing revisions and current stable working version.
	* After trying many things to debug, I am pausing and going to tag this version
	* Readme updated with some info incase Geant4 peeps want to take a look

2014-02-12 Matt:
	* Committing some revisions and additions.

2014-02-05 Matt:
	* Adding output directory for output files

2014-02-04 Matt:
	* Creating repository for simple study of shower properties in various mediums
	* Adding basic detector construction
	* Including skeleton of executable
	* Adding makefile copied from ELS_mrelich
	* Adding physics list -- right now just gamma, e+, e-, and some EM physics processes
	* Adding run and event action
	* Adding primary action generator
