Please put your lookup tables here, following the naming convention
given by Romain.  

TODO: Maybe have the lookup tables just contain the antenna position
and information.  As it is done right now, one has to specify the 
antennas separately, and make sure that there is a lookup table
for each antenna...  Not the best option I think.
